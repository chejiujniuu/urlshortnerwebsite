URL Shortener â€“ Project Description
The URL Shortener is a full-stack web application designed to simplify the process of sharing lengthy URLs by converting them into short, manageable links. Built using Java Spring Boot for the backend and React.js for the frontend, this project demonstrates seamless integration of modern web technologies to deliver a clean and efficient user experience.

Users can input long URLs through a responsive and interactive React-based frontend. Upon submission, the request is sent to the backend via a REST API built using Spring Boot. The backend then processes the URL, generates a unique short code, stores the mapping in a database (such as MySQL or H2), and returns the shortened link to the user. When the short link is accessed, the system decodes the short code, fetches the original URL from the database, and redirects the user to the intended destination.

The system supports error handling (e.g., invalid URLs, non-existent short codes) and can optionally be extended to include analytics features such as click tracking, expiration dates for links, or user authentication for managing personal links.

Core Features:
Generate unique short URLs for any valid long URL

Redirect users to the original URL upon visiting the short URL

Responsive user interface built using React.js

RESTful backend using Java Spring Boot

Basic URL validation and error handling

Database integration for persistent storage of URL mappings

Technology Stack:
Frontend: React.js, Axios, Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap

Backend: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Web

Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or H2 (in-memory for testing)

Tools: Postman (API testing), Git & GitHub, Maven

Use Cases:
Simplifying long URLs for easy sharing on social media

Creating branded or customized short links

Tracking the number of times a short link is accessed

This project not only improves usability for daily web users but also serves as a valuable learning experience in full-stack web development, RESTful API design, and deployment of microservices.
